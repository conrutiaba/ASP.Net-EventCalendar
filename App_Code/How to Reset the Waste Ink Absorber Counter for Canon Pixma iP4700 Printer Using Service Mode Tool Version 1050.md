# How to Reset the Waste Ink Absorber Counter for Canon Pixma iP4700 Printer Using Service Mode Tool Version 1.050
  
If you own a Canon Pixma iP4700 printer, you may encounter a message like "Waste tank full" or "Ink absorber full" after a certain number of prints. This means that the internal counter for the waste ink absorber has reached its limit and you need to reset it to continue printing. The waste ink absorber is a sponge-like component that collects the excess ink during cleaning and printing operations. It is located at the bottom of the printer and can be replaced or washed when it gets full.

In this article, we will show you how to reset the waste ink absorber counter for your Canon Pixma iP4700 printer using a software called Service Mode Tool Version 1.050. This software is not officially provided by Canon and may have been leaked illegally on the internet, so we cannot give you a direct link or download instructions. You will have to find it yourself using a search engine.
  
Before you use the software, you need to put your printer in service mode. This is a special mode that allows you to access and modify some settings of your printer. To do this, follow these steps:
  
1. Switch off your printer.
2. Push and hold the "Resume" button.
3. Push and hold the "Power" button.
4. Hold both buttons for about five seconds.
5. Let go of the "Resume" button.
6. Press the "Resume" button twice.
7. Let go of the "Power" button.

When the green LED stops blinking and lights continuously, your printer is in service mode.
  
Now you can run the Service Mode Tool Version 1.050 software on your computer. Make sure your printer is connected to your computer via USB cable. When you open the software, you should see a window like this:

To reset the waste ink absorber counter, click on the "Set" button next to "Clear Ink Counter". You should see a message like "Clearing OK".
  
To check if the counter has been reset successfully, click on the "EEPROM" tab and then click on the "EEPROM" button. Your printer will print out a status page that shows the percentage of the waste ink absorber filling level. It should be zero or close to zero.
  
To exit the service mode, switch off your printer and then switch it on again.
  
Congratulations! You have successfully reset the waste ink absorber counter for your Canon Pixma iP4700 printer using Service Mode Tool Version 1.050. However, this does not mean that your waste ink absorber is actually empty. You should also replace or wash it to prevent ink leakage and damage to your printer. You can find instructions on how to do that in this article: [Workshop: Change Waste-Ink-Tank Canon Pixma iP4000](https://www.druckerchannel.de/artikel.php?ID=2732).
